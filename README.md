# whatsapp_ui_clone

A new Flutter project that shows my implementation of the UI of 
the WhatsApp Messenger app.

The inspiration came from the Youtube video by "rivaan ranawat", from where 
I added some other features (like: adding the screens to the status and calls screen) while learning flutter.

The dummy data used in this repo is "rivaan ranawat's" own, with some minor changes..

I hope you find inspiration from this repo......
